Hey there! :D

I'm MÃ¡rio Fernandes (he/his), I am a physicist and also a data scientist!

I currently work at ION Sistemas, and I am also about to finish my PhD in quantum information/computation.

After being hired, I have been studying machine learning algorithms and python, and I think I fell in love :heartbeat:

I'm always eager to leran new things!
