Hey there! :D

I'm MÃ¡rio Fernandes (he/his), I am a physicist and also a machine learning engineer!

I currently work at Via Varejo, and I am also about to finish my PhD in quantum information/computation.

I have been studying machine learning algorithms, MLOps and python, and I am definitely in love :heartbeat:

I'm always eager to learn new things!
